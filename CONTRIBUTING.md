# Contributing to Onionr
One of the great things about open source projects is that they allow for many people to contribute to the project. This file should serve as a guideline when contributing to Onionr.

## Code of Conduct
Most of these should be common sense. But just in case, I will clarify a couple rules:

 - **Don't spam or attack.**
   - Nobody likes to deal with people who spam comments, messages, pull requests, issues, etc
   - Don't spam comment "I agree" on an issue suggesting a new feature, for example. Use `:thumbsup:`
   - Keep things like commit messages concise, don't submit an essay in a comment in response to a GitHub issue
   - Make commits when something is changed *and* tested
 - **Stay professional.**
   - Be kind and responsible
   - Avoid the use of content that may offend others
   - GitHub Issues is not a good place to be having an off-topic conversation
   - Assume people from around the world will be reading your comments, messages, commit messages, etc, and write them accordingly
